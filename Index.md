# Javalent's Wonderful World of Plugins

Welcome to Javalent's Plugins  **[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)**. 

You know 'em, you love 'em, now here is how to use them.

## Javalent's Fantasy System

With Javalent's plugins, you can enhance your Table Top Roleplaying experience in Obsidian.

The plugins beginning with "Fantasy" are specifically designed for this purpose.

For example:
- The Fantasy Calendar plugin allows you to keep track of in-game time, with features like tracking era changes and creating events.
- The Fantasy Bestiary plugin helps you keep track of the different creatures and beings in your game world
- The Fantasy Statblocks plugin allows you to quickly generate detailed character sheets and NPC statistics.

By using these plugins in with your notes, you can create a dynamic and immersive world for your roleplaying adventures. Whether you're tracking character stats as a player, managing world-building details as game master, or simply keeping a detailed timeline of events as a writer, these plugins help provide the tools you need to bring the fantasy to reality.
