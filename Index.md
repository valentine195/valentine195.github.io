## The Fantasy System

With the Fantasy System of Plugins, you can enhance your Table Top Roleplaying experience in Obsidian.

The plugins beginning with "Fantasy" are specifically designed for this purpose.

For example:
- The Fantasy Calendar plugin allows you to keep track of in-game time, with features like tracking era changes and creating events.
- The Fantasy Bestiary plugin helps you keep track of the different creatures and beings in your game world
- The Fantasy Statblocks plugin allows you to quickly generate detailed character sheets and NPC statistics.

By using these plugins in with your notes, you can create a dynamic and immersive world for your roleplaying adventures. Whether you're tracking character stats as a player, managing world-building details as game master, or simply keeping a detailed timeline of events as a writer, these plugins help provide the tools you need to bring the fantasy to reality.
