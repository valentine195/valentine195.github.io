# Javalent's Wonderful World of Plugins

Welcome to Javalent's Plugins  **[Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md)**. 

You know 'em, you love 'em, now here is how to use them.

## The Fantasy System
{: .d-flex .float-left}
With the Fantasy System of Plugins, you can enhance your Table Top Roleplaying experience in Obsidian.
{: .d-flex .float-left}
The plugins in "The Fantasy System" navigation pane are specifically designed for this purpose.
{: .d-flex .float-left}
For example:
- The Fantasy Calendar plugin allows you to keep track of in-game time, with features like tracking era changes and creating events.
- The Fantasy Bestiary plugin helps you keep track of the different creatures and beings in your game world
- The Fantasy Statblocks plugin allows you to quickly generate detailed character sheets and NPC statistics.

By using these plugins in with your notes, you can create a dynamic and immersive world for your roleplaying adventures. Whether you're tracking character stats as a player, managing world-building details as game master, or simply keeping a detailed timeline of events as a writer, these plugins help provide the tools you need to bring the fantasy to reality.{: .d-flex .float-left}

## The Utility System

With the Utility System of Plugins, you can augment your Obsidian environment with quality of life tools that feel like they are core features.
{: .d-flex .float-right}
The plugins in the "Obsidian Utilities" navigation pane are crafted with care to meet this design need.
{: .d-flex .float-right}
For example:
- Admonition allows you to create easy to use and beautiful looking custom callouts, with the inherit stability and functionality of a code block. 
- Image Window remains the most reliable way to display content on a second screen from Obsidian. The core function is native to Obsidian, but is subject to limitations that Image Window does not have. 
- Markdown Attributes brings a greater expansion of targeted CSS styling through the use of `{ .class }` and `{ id=example .myclass }` markers within the note.
